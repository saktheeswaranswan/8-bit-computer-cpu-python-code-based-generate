# 8-Bit Computer in Logisim
https://github.com/Abijeet123/8-bit-computer-in-logisim.git
This is my 8-bit SAP that i build watching ben eather youtube playlist.

While studying the 8085 microprocessor, I was looking for resources to deepen my understanding of its internal workings. I came across the r/emudev subreddit, where I saw people building interesting projects in Logisim. This led me to discover Ben Eater's 8-bit SAP-1 YouTube playlist. After completing my studies on the 8085, I went through the entire playlist and implemented the SAP-1 in Logisim.

You can check out a recorded demonstration of the Division program on my Twitter post [here](https://x.com/0xJatinChopra/status/1818348699078250912).


## Project Overview

This project simulates a simple 8-bit computer with the following key components and specifications:

- **Registers:**
  - **Accumulator**: An 8-bit register for arithmetic and logic operations.
  - **B Register**: Another 8-bit register used in conjunction with the Accumulator.
  - **Temporary Register**: An 8-bit register used during instruction execution.

- **Program Counter (PC):** A 4-bit parallel load register that keeps track of the next instruction to execute.

- **Memory Address Register (MAR):** A 4-bit register that holds the address of the memory location to be accessed.

- **RAM:** 16 bytes of memory used for storing both data and instructions.

- **Instruction Register (IR):** An 8-bit register that holds the current instruction being executed.

- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):**
  - Performs 8-bit addition and subtraction.
  - Affects the Carry and Zero flags based on the operation results.

- **Control Logic (Instruction Decoder):** Implemented using a 1K x 20 ROM that decodes instructions and generates control signals.

## Instruction Set

The instruction set includes the following commands:

- `LDA`: Load the Accumulator with the contents of a memory location.
- `ADD`: Add the contents of a memory location to the Accumulator.
- `JMP`: Jump to a specific memory location.
- `JC`: Jump to a specific memory location if the Carry flag is set.
- `STA`: Store the contents of the Accumulator in a memory location.
- `ADI`: Add an immediate value to the Accumulator.
- `SUB`: Subtract the contents of a memory location from the Accumulator.
- `OUT`: Output the contents of the Accumulator.
- `JZ`: Jump to a specific memory location if the Zero flag is set.
- `SUI`: Subtract an immediate value from the Accumulator.
- `HLT`: Halt the execution of the program.

### Capabilities

With the above instructions, this computer can:

- Move data in and out of RAM.
- Perform arithmetic operations on data stored in registers.
- Execute unconditional and conditional jumps.

These functionalities make the computer Turing Complete. There is still space left for 4 more instructions to be added.

Below are the resources that I've used: 
I started by stuyding about microprocessor 8085 and microcontroller 8051 while studying about them i came across ben eater youtube channler and emudev subreddit, I was amazed by looking at the cool projects people were building 
so thats how i decided of building a simple implementation.


### Programming 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e98424-d7c2-4128-9f84-51a10487147c)

In order to program it you need to set `toggle_address_mode` & `prog_bus_toggle` pin to 1 and then you can feed the memory address through the `prog_addr` and can input the instructions through `prog_data`.
